# ESP32-CPM80

My first Open Source Project.  I'd like to thank Alexander Demin for his 8080 CPU code!
You can find his code here https://github.com/begoon/i8080-core

Requirements:
* Espressif ESP32 WROOM-32D developer board
* Support for ESP32 core in Arduino IDE
* USB to TTY converter - RXD2 = 16 | TXD2 = 17
* (optional) two LEDs - Write: IO12  Read: IO04
